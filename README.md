## The Golden Rule 🧠

**Modifiers are applied from top to bottom, each wrapping the previous one like nesting boxes.**

Think of it like putting on clothes: underwear → shirt → jacket → coat. Each layer wraps the previous ones!

```kotlin
Modifier
    .size(100.dp)          // 📦 Outermost box: 100x100dp
    .padding(10.dp)        // 📦 Middle box: 80x80dp content area  
    .background(Color.Red) // 📦 Innermost: red background on 80x80dp
```



**Remember: Think of modifiers as layers of wrapping paper - each one wraps everything that came before it!** 🎁

*Happy Composing!* 🚀
